Evaluation tools for assessing climate adaptation of fruit tree species

The fruit trees annualy cycle through biological events in response to climate cues.
The timing of these responses is known as the phenology the plant. Historical trends 
in phenological events are useful indicators of system change in response to climate 
change. 
It is important to quantitatively estimate climate influence on fruit tree production 
(in quantity and quality) both in the design stage of orchards, and in the evaluation 
of the potential consequences of future climate. This package offer tools to estimate 
fruit tree phenology and the risks of occurrence of adverse effects (lack of chill, 
spring frosts, sunburn, wind scab, russet) and evaluate the weather during pollination 
season, and fruit color potential for red-skinned apples. The functions provided here 
are suitable for pome and stone fruit species, and grapevines.
