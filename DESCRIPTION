Description: Climate is a critical component limiting growing range of plant species, which
    also determines cultivar adaptation to a region. The evaluation of climate influence on
    fruit production is critical for decision-making in the design stage of orchards and 
    vineyards and in the evaluation of the potential consequences of future climate. Bio-
    climatic indices and plant phenology are commonly used to describe the suitability of 
    climate for growing quality fruit and to provide temporal and spatial information about 
    regarding ongoing and future changes.  ‘fruclimadapt’ streamlines the assessment of 
    climate adaptation and the identification of potential risks for grapevines and fruit 
    trees. Procedures in the package allow to i) downscale daily meteorological variables
    to hourly values, ii) estimate chilling and forcing heat accumulation, iii) estimate 
    plant phenology, iv) calculate bioclimatic indices to evaluate fruit tree and grapevine
    adaptation, v) estimate the indicence of weather-related disorders in fruits and vi)
    estimate plant water requirements.
