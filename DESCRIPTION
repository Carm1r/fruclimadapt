Description: Climate is a critical component limiting growing range of plant species, which
    also determines cultivar adaptation to a region. The evaluation of climate influence on
    fruit production is critical for decision-making in the design stage of orchards and 
    vineyards and in the evaluation of the potential consequences of future climate. Bio-
    climatic indices and plant phenology are commonly used to describe the suitability of 
    climate for growing quality fruit and to provide temporal and spatial information about 
    regarding ongoing and future changes.  ‘fruclimadapt’ streamlines the assessment of 
    climate adaptation and the identification of potential risks for grapevines and fruit 
    trees. Procedures in the package allow to i) generate hourly weather data from daily 
    values, ii) estimate chilling and forcing heat units, iii) estimate plant phenology, 
    iv) calculate bioclimatic indices to evaluate fruit tree and grapevine adaptation, v) 
    estimate plant water requirements and vi) estimate the incidence of weather accidents.
