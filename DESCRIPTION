Description: The fruit trees annualy cycle through biological events in response to climate cues.
    The timing of these responses is known as the phenology the plant. Historical trends in 
    phenological events are useful indicators of system change in response to climate change. 
    It is important to quantitatively estimate climate influence on fruit tree production (in
    quantity and quality) both in the design stage of orchards, and in the evaluation of the 
    potential consequences of future climate. This package offer tools to estimate fruit tree 
    phenology and the risks of occurrence of adverse effects (lack of chill, spring frosts, 
    sunburn, wind scab, russet) and evaluate the weather during pollination season, and fruit
    color potential for red-skinned fruit. Since version 0.1.5 it provides tools to estimate
    potential evapotranspiration and bioclimatic indices (Huglin, Winkler, Cool Nigths, Branas
    and Dryness) to estimate grapevine adaptation. Since verssion 0.2.0 includes functions to
    evaluate spring frost risks. The functions provided here are suitable for
    pome and stone fruit species, and grapevines.
