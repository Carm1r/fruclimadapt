## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have fixed some problems with dependencies. 
* data.table and zoo are now called exclusively for the functions used
* fixed a syntax error in a functioncheck in pollination_weather
* examples have been reworked to reduce execution time

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.2.2
* local Win10 install, R 4.2.2
* Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC (on R-hub), R 4.2.2
* Fedora Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (on R-hub)
